# IBAnimatable Playground
**IBAnimatable Playground** is a playground to see the features IBAnimatable can support for prototyping and designing UI, animations, transitions and interactions. You can find your favourite effects and apply them in Interface Builder. 

The `code` folder is not mandatory for the demo App. **The app was made in Interface Builder with `IBAnimatable` without a single line of code**. 

Because we want to demonstrate more effects (e.g. animations, transitions) with only one Scene in Interface Builder. In most of Apps, we usually apply one effect to one View or Scene, then we can configure that effect in Interface Builder without any code.
